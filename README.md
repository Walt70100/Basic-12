# Basic-12
Here's another simple BASIC code example that finds the largest number among a set of numbers entered by the user.

In this code:

- The program first prompts the user to enter the number of values they want to compare using the INPUT command.
- It checks if N is less than 1 and asks the user to enter at least one value if the input is invalid.
- It initializes the variable Max with the first entered value.
- It uses a FOR loop to iterate through the remaining values, prompting the user for each value.
- Inside the loop, it compares each value with the current maximum (Max) and updates Max if the new value is greater.
- After all values have been processed, it prints out the largest value.
This code demonstrates how to use loops, conditions, and user input to find the largest number among a set of values in BASIC.
